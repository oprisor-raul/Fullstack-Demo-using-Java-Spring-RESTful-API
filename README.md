# Bottom Lines from the Project:
The main takeaway from this project is a better and much clearer understanding of the Java Spring framework and how it can be used. 

List of key details that I got a deeper understanding of:
  - Through building this project, I gained a deep understanding of how the Java Spring framework can be used to create robust and scalable web applications.
  - Through this project, I gained experience in utilizing the Spring Web MVC framework to handle HTTP requests and format responses.
  - Through implementing courses and professor data management features, I became capable of using Spring Data JPA to interact with a database and perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.
  - By using Maven, I gained a deeper understanding of how to create and manage projects with multiple modules and dependencies, and how to configure and customize the build process to suit specific project requirements.
  - Working with Docker, I gained a deeper understanding of how containerization can simplify the development and deployment process, and provide a more efficient way of managing software dependencies.
  - A good opportunity for me to sharpen my HTML and CSS skills, so I can create a more polished and professional-looking user interface.
